SecuroText3000 will take unencrypted text files and encrypt the content utilizing a highly modified Vigenere cipher key. The increased key deviates from the typical alphabetical system, which increases the difficulty in cracking when the full key is not known.  

Simply input the .txt file to be encrypted, enter your "secret word" as the encryptor, and select encrypt.  SecuroText3000 will output the content to screen and a text file in your current directory.  To decrypt simply enter the encrypted text file, add your secret word, and select decrypt.
